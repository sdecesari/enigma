# enigma

## Functionality = 3
Encrypt and Decrypt are successfully implemented. CLI is successfully implemented and handles uppercase characters as well as characters not included in the character set.

## OOP = 3
Project is broken up by two classes and two runner files. Each class has a single responsibility. No class is more than 100 lines long.

## Ruby Conventions and Mechanics = 3.5
Everything is well named and code is all properly indented and syntax is consistent. Two methods are longer than 10 lines. I attempted to break these apart but I broke things so decided it was better kept as a single method. Multiple hashes were created and successfully called on.

## TDD = 3
Every method is tested at the unit and integration level. All obvious(obvious to me at least) edge cases are addressed. Set up all tests before methods were created. SimpleCov is at 100%.

## Version Control = 4
I have 56 commits and 10 pull requests. All requests include related and logical chunks of functionality and communicate the purpose of the pull request.
